## SECTION 1: HISTORICAL FOUNDATION & PHILOSOPHY

### 1.1 Origins of Chiropractic

**D.D. Palmer - Founder (1895):**
- Daniel David Palmer, magnetic healer in Davenport, Iowa
- **September 18, 1895:** First chiropractic adjustment on Harvey Lillard (janitor with hearing loss for 17 years)
- Palmer adjusted a vertebra in Lillard's spine â†’ Lillard's hearing reportedly restored
- **Theory:** Misaligned vertebrae (subluxations) interfere with nerve function â†’ disease; adjusting spine restores nerve flow â†’ health

**B.J. Palmer - Developer:**
- D.D.'s son, expanded and systematized chiropractic
- Established Palmer School of Chiropractic (1897, now Palmer College)
- Coined term "innate intelligence" - body's inherent healing ability
- Promoted chiropractic as distinct profession separate from medicine

**Early Controversies:**
- Accused of practicing medicine without license
- Legal battles established chiropractic as separate profession
- Chiropractors jailed for practicing medicine (early 1900s)
- Gradual state-by-state licensure (all 50 states by 1974)

**Evolution:**
- **Straight chiropractic (traditional):** Subluxation-only focus, vitalism, skeptical of vaccines/drugs
- **Mixer chiropractic (modern mainstream):** Evidence-based, integrates other therapies (nutrition, rehab), collaborates with MDs
- Modern chiropractic increasingly evidence-based and integrated into healthcare system

### 1.2 Chiropractic Philosophy

**Core Concepts:**

**1. Innate Intelligence:**
- Body has inherent wisdom to heal itself
- Nervous system coordinates healing and function
- Remove interference (subluxations) â†’ body heals naturally
- **Modern interpretation:** Homeostasis, self-regulation (less mystical, more physiological)

**2. Subluxation:**
- **Traditional definition:** Misalignment of vertebra causing nerve interference
- **Modern definition:** Joint dysfunction (hypomobility, biomechanical dysfunction) affecting surrounding tissues
- **Controversy:** "Vertebral subluxation complex" not well-defined or universally accepted in medical community
- **Evidence-based view:** Joint dysfunction/restriction exists and can benefit from manipulation, but "nerve interference" theory oversimplified

**3. Tone (Muscle Tone):**
- Proper nerve supply maintains optimal muscle tone
- Subluxations alter tone â†’ dysfunction
- Adjustment restores tone

**4. The Triune of Health:**
- **Structural:** Spine, musculoskeletal system
- **Chemical:** Nutrition, toxins, hormones
- **Mental/Emotional:** Stress, emotions, thoughts
- All three interact; chiropractic addresses primarily structural but considers others

**5. Above-Down, Inside-Out:**
- Health comes from above (brain) down (through spine to body), inside (innate) out (to expression)
- Vitalistic philosophy - life force flows from brain through nerves

**Modern Evidence-Based Perspective:**
- Retains focus on spinal health, nervous system, holistic care
- De-emphasizes vitalism, subluxation as cause of all disease
- Emphasizes musculoskeletal conditions, evidence-based treatment
- Collaborative, integrative approach

### 1.3 Education & Licensure

### 1.4 Chiropractic vs. Other Professions

**Chiropractic vs. Physical Therapy:**
- **Overlap:** Both treat musculoskeletal conditions with manual therapy, exercise
- **Chiropractic focus:** Spinal manipulation (thrust adjustments), shorter treatment sessions (10-20 min)
- **PT focus:** Therapeutic exercise, longer sessions (30-60 min), more rehab emphasis
- **Education:** DC 4 years post-bachelor's; PT now requires DPT (3 years post-bachelor's)

**Chiropractic vs. Osteopathy (DO):**
- **Osteopaths (DO):** Full medical doctors with additional osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT) training
- **Can prescribe drugs, perform surgery (like MDs)**
- **Philosophy overlap:** Both holistic, body's self-healing, manipulation
- **Practice:** Most DOs practice like MDs; <10% regularly use OMT
- **Chiropractic:** More manipulation-focused, no prescribing

**Chiropractic vs. Massage Therapy:**
- **Chiropractic:** High-velocity low-amplitude thrusts (HVLA - "cracking"), joint mobilization
- **Massage:** Soft tissue work (muscles), no joint manipulation
- **Education:** DC 4 years; LMT 500-1,000 hours
- **Scope:** Chiropractors diagnose; massage therapists do not

## SECTION 2: SPINAL ANATOMY & BIOMECHANICS

### 2.1 Spinal Anatomy

**Regions:**
- **Cervical (Neck):** 7 vertebrae (C1-C7)
  - C1 (Atlas): No spinous process, articulates with skull (occiput)
  - C2 (Axis): Has dens (odontoid process) - allows C1 to rotate on it (head rotation)
  - C3-C7: Typical cervical vertebrae with bifid spinous processes
- **Thoracic (Mid-back):** 12 vertebrae (T1-T12)
  - Articulate with ribs
  - Limited mobility (ribs restrict)
- **Lumbar (Low back):** 5 vertebrae (L1-L5)
  - Large vertebral bodies (bear most weight)
  - Most mobile in flexion/extension
- **Sacrum:** 5 fused vertebrae (S1-S5)
  - Connects spine to pelvis (sacroiliac joints)
- **Coccyx (Tailbone):** 3-5 fused vertebrae

**Spinal Curves:**
- **Cervical lordosis (concave posterior):** Develops when infant lifts head
- **Thoracic kyphosis (convex posterior):** Primary curve (present at birth)
- **Lumbar lordosis (concave posterior):** Develops when infant stands/walks
- **Sacral kyphosis:** Primary curve
- **Purpose:** Shock absorption (10x more resilient than straight spine), balance head over pelvis

**Intervertebral Discs:**
- **Nucleus pulposus (center):** Gel-like, 80% water, compressible
- **Annulus fibrosus (outer rings):** Collagen fibers, contains nucleus
- **Function:** Shock absorption, allow movement
- **Degeneration:** Discs lose water with age â†’ height loss, less shock absorption

**Facet Joints:**
- Paired joints on posterior spine (between articular processes)
- Synovial joints (contain fluid)
- **Function:** Guide and limit motion, bear 20% of spinal load (discs bear 80%)
- **Degeneration:** Osteoarthritis common with aging

**Spinal Ligaments:**
- **Anterior longitudinal ligament (ALL):** Front of vertebral bodies, limits extension
- **Posterior longitudinal ligament (PLL):** Back of vertebral bodies (in spinal canal), limits flexion
- **Ligamentum flavum:** Between laminae, elastic, limits flexion
- **Interspinous/supraspinous:** Between spinous processes, limit flexion

**Spinal Cord & Nerve Roots:**
- **Spinal cord:** Ends at L1-L2 (conus medullaris)
- **Cauda equina:** Nerve roots below L2 (look like horse's tail)
- **Nerve roots:** Exit through intervertebral foramina (openings between vertebrae)
  - 8 cervical nerve roots (C1-C8; note: only 7 cervical vertebrae)
  - 12 thoracic, 5 lumbar, 5 sacral, 1 coccygeal

**Dermatomes & Myotomes:**
- **Dermatome:** Skin area supplied by single nerve root (sensory)
- **Myotome:** Muscles supplied by single nerve root (motor)
- **Clinical use:** Identify nerve root involvement by sensory/motor deficits

### 2.2 Biomechanics

**Spinal Motion:**
- **Flexion:** Forward bending
- **Extension:** Backward bending
- **Lateral flexion:** Side bending
- **Rotation:** Twisting
- **Coupled motion:** Movement in one plane produces movement in another
  - Example: Cervical spine - lateral flexion couples with rotation to same side

**Range of Motion (Normal):**
- **Cervical:** Flexion 50Â°, extension 60Â°, lateral flexion 45Â° each, rotation 80Â° each
- **Thoracic:** Limited by ribs; rotation 35Â° each side
- **Lumbar:** Flexion 60Â°, extension 25Â°, lateral flexion 25Â° each, rotation 20Â° each

**Load Distribution:**
- **Discs:** Bear 80% of compressive load
- **Facet joints:** Bear 20%
- **Increased load:** Obesity, poor posture, lifting

**Posture:**
- **Ideal:** Plumb line from ear â†’ shoulder â†’ hip â†’ knee â†’ ankle
- **Common deviations:**
  - **Forward head posture:** Head anterior to shoulders (common with computer/phone use)
    - Increases load on cervical spine (every inch forward = 10 lbs extra load)
  - **Anterior pelvic tilt:** Excessive lumbar lordosis, tight hip flexors
  - **Posterior pelvic tilt:** Reduced lumbar lordosis, tight hamstrings
  - **Scoliosis:** Lateral curvature of spine

### 3.2 Physical Examination

**Observation:**
- **Posture:** Standing (anterior, posterior, lateral views)
- **Gait:** Walking pattern, antalgic (limping), Trendelenburg (hip drop)
- **Spinal curves:** Scoliosis, hyperkyphosis, hyperlordosis

**Palpation:**
- **Static palpation:** Bony landmarks (spinous processes, transverse processes), muscle tone/spasm, tenderness
- **Motion palpation:** Assess joint movement (hypomobile vs. hypermobile segments)
  - Chiropractor moves each vertebral segment, assesses resistance, end-feel
  - Identifies "fixations" (restricted segments) - target for adjustment

**Range of Motion (ROM):**
- **Active ROM:** Patient moves (cervical, lumbar - flexion, extension, lateral flexion, rotation)
- **Passive ROM:** Examiner moves
- **Compare:** Side-to-side, to normal values

**Orthopedic Tests:**
- **Cervical:**
  - **Spurling's test:** Extension + rotation + compression â†’ radiating arm pain (cervical radiculopathy)
  - **Distraction test:** Traction on head â†’ relief of arm pain (confirms nerve compression)
- **Lumbar:**
  - **Straight leg raise (SLR):** Leg elevation â†’ radiating leg pain <70Â° (sciatica, disc herniation)
  - **Patrick's (FABER) test:** Hip flexion, abduction, external rotation â†’ groin pain (hip pathology) or SI joint pain
  - **Kemp's test:** Extension + rotation â†’ radicular pain (facet syndrome, stenosis, disc herniation)

**Neurological Exam:**
- **Reflexes:** Biceps (C5-C6), triceps (C7-C8), patellar (L3-L4), Achilles (S1-S2)
- **Sensation:** Light touch, pinprick (dermatomes)
- **Motor:** Muscle strength testing (myotomes)
  - Cervical: C5 (deltoid), C6 (biceps), C7 (triceps), C8 (hand intrinsics)
  - Lumbar: L2-L3 (hip flexors), L4 (quadriceps), L5 (dorsiflexors - toe extension), S1 (plantarflexors - toe flexion)

**Leg Length Analysis:**
- **Functional vs. structural leg length discrepancy**
- Measured supine (ASIS to medial malleolus)
- **Functional:** Pelvic tilt, muscle imbalance
- **Structural:** Actual bone length difference (needs heel lift if >1 cm)

### 3.3 Diagnostic Imaging

**X-rays (Radiographs):**
- **When indicated:**
  - Trauma (rule out fracture)
  - Red flags present
  - Age >50 with new back pain
  - Failed conservative treatment (6-8 weeks)

- **Findings:** Alignment, bone spurs (osteophytes), disc space narrowing, fracture, spondylolisthesis, scoliosis
- **Limitations:** Soft tissue not visible (discs, nerves, ligaments)

**MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging):**
- **Best for:** Disc herniations, nerve compression, spinal cord pathology, soft tissue
- **When indicated:** Red flags, severe/progressive neurological deficit, considering surgery
- **Limitations:** Expensive, many abnormalities asymptomatic (bulging discs common in asymptomatic people)

**CT Scan:**
- **Best for:** Bone detail, fractures
- **When indicated:** Trauma, post-surgical evaluation

**Chiropractors Can Order Imaging:**
- X-rays routinely (most states)
- MRI/CT (most states with referral or directly)
- **Controversy:** Overuse of X-rays in chiropractic (routine full-spine X-rays criticized)

## SECTION 4: ADJUSTMENT TECHNIQUES

### 4.1 High-Velocity Low-Amplitude (HVLA) Thrust

**Definition:**
- Quick, controlled thrust applied to specific vertebra
- Produces audible "crack" or "pop" (cavitation - gas bubbles released from joint)

**Mechanism:**
- **Cavitation:** Joint gapped beyond normal ROM â†’ pressure drop â†’ dissolved gas forms bubbles â†’ pop sound
- **Not "bones cracking"** (common misconception)
- **Neurophysiological effects:** Stimulates mechanoreceptors, inhibits pain signals (gate control theory), reflex muscle relaxation

**Diversified Technique (Most Common):**
- Short-lever, high-velocity thrusts
- Specific line of drive based on joint position
- Used for all spinal regions
- Side-posture lumbar adjustment (patient lies on side, chiropractor applies rotational thrust)
- Prone thoracic adjustment (patient face-down)
- Supine cervical adjustment (patient face-up, neck rotated)

**Gonstead Technique:**
- Very specific, analytical approach
- Uses instrumentation (Nervoscope - detects heat differences along spine)
- Chair adjustment for cervical spine
- Knee-chest position for lumbar/pelvic
- Emphasis on listing (direction of misalignment)

**Thompson Technique (Drop Table):**
- Special table with sections that "drop" when thrust applied
- Drop assists adjustment (momentum)
- Gentler than manual thrust alone
- Used for patients who don't tolerate forceful adjustments

**Toggle Recoil:**
- Quick thrust followed by immediate withdrawal (recoil)
- Used in upper cervical specific techniques
- Minimal rotation of neck

### 4.2 Mobilization (Low-Velocity)

**Joint Mobilization:**
- Passive oscillatory movements within or at limit of joint ROM
- **Graded (Maitland Scale):**
  - Grade I-II: Small amplitude, within ROM (pain relief)
  - Grade III-IV: Larger amplitude, into resistance (increase mobility)
- Gentler than HVLA, no cavitation
- Good for: Acute pain, elderly, osteoporosis, patient preference

**Articulation:**
- Repetitive gentle movements through joint ROM
- Improves mobility, reduces stiffness

### 4.3 Activator Method

**Instrument-Assisted:**
- Activator tool: Spring-loaded device delivers precise, low-force impulse
- Very gentle (no manual thrust)
- Good for: Children, elderly, osteoporosis, acute pain, patient anxiety about manual adjustments

### 4.4 Flexion-Distraction (Cox Technique)

**Specialized Table:**
- Table flexes, distracts, and applies lateral flexion
- Gentle, rhythmic pumping motion
- **Mechanism:** Increases disc space, reduces intradiscal pressure, improves disc nutrition
- **Best for:** Disc herniations, sciatica, spinal stenosis

### 4.5 Soft Tissue Techniques

**Myofascial Release:**
- Sustained pressure on tight fascia/muscles
- Releases restrictions, improves mobility

**Trigger Point Therapy:**
- Sustained pressure on trigger points (hyperirritable spots in muscle)
- Ischemic compression (reduces blood flow â†’ release)

**Graston Technique / IASTM:**
- Instrument-Assisted Soft Tissue Mobilization
- Stainless steel tools scrape along muscles
- Breaks up adhesions, scar tissue

**Active Release Technique (ART):**
- Movement + pressure on adhesions
- Proprietary technique

- **Treatment:**
  - Gentle cervical distraction
  - Avoid: Aggressive rotation (can worsen)
  - Spinal decompression
  - Nerve gliding exercises
- **Evidence:** **Limited** - some benefit from gentle mobilization/traction
- **Referral:** If severe, progressive weakness, not improving

**Tension Headaches:**
- **Symptoms:** Bilateral band-like headache, occipital/temporal, tension in neck
- **Treatment:**
  - Upper cervical and cervicothoracic adjustments
  - Soft tissue work (suboccipitals, upper traps)

- Frequency: Weekly to monthly (varies by philosophy)

**Controversy:**
- **Supportive view:** Preventive care, optimize function, like dental cleanings
- **Critical view:** Lack of evidence for prevention; creates dependency
- **Evidence:** **Weak to non-existent** - no strong evidence that maintenance care prevents future problems
- **Consensus:** Appropriate if patient derives subjective benefit and understands evidence limitations; not mandatory

---

## SECTION 6: EVIDENCE BASE

### 6.1 Strong Evidence

**Acute Low Back Pain:**
- **Multiple RCTs and systematic reviews** show spinal manipulation effective (comparable to NSAIDs, better than placebo)
- Short-term pain relief and improved function
- Example: Cochrane Review (2019) supports manipulation for acute low back pain

**Chronic Low Back Pain:**
- **Moderate evidence** for short-term benefit
- Combination with exercise more effective than manipulation alone

**Acute Neck Pain:**
- **Moderate-strong evidence** for manipulation/mobilization
- Comparable to medication or exercise

**Chronic Mechanical Neck Pain:**
- **Moderate evidence** for manipulation
- May be more effective than medication or exercise alone

**Cervicogenic Headaches:**
- **Moderate evidence** for manipulation reducing frequency and intensity

**Tension Headaches:**
- **Moderate evidence** for short-term reduction

### 6.2 Moderate/Limited Evidence

**Migraines:**
- Mixed evidence; some studies show benefit, others do not
- May help some patients, but not first-line treatment

**Disc Herniations:**
- Limited evidence for flexion-distraction
- Many patients improve, but natural history of disc herniations is favorable (most resolve conservatively)

**Non-Spinal Conditions:**
- Limited evidence for shoulder, elbow, knee, ankle conditions
- Some benefit likely, but less research than spinal conditions

### 6.3 No Evidence / Not Recommended

**Serious Medical Conditions:**
- **No evidence** chiropractic treats: infections, cancer, organ disease, diabetes, etc.
- Some chiropractors make inappropriate claims (criticized within profession)

**Infant Colic:**
- **Poor evidence** - studies low quality, conflicting results
- Controversial (some chiropractors treat infants, others disagree)

**Asthma, Allergies, Ear Infections:**
- **No credible evidence** for effectiveness
- Claims based on outdated subluxation theory

### 6.4 Research Quality

**Challenges:**
- Difficult to blind (patients know when adjusted)
- Sham manipulation hard to create (control group)
- Heterogeneity (many techniques, variable training)
- Industry bias (some chiropractic-funded research low quality)

**Progress:**
- More high-quality RCTs in recent decades
- Integration into multidisciplinary research

## SECTION 7: SAFETY & CONTRAINDICATIONS

### 7.1 Safety Record

**Generally Safe:**
- Serious adverse events **rare** when performed by licensed chiropractor on appropriate patients
- Minor side effects common: Temporary soreness, stiffness, fatigue (24-48 hours post-adjustment)

**Risks:**

**Cervical Manipulation - Vertebrobasilar Artery (VBA) Stroke:**
- **Most serious risk**
- Mechanism: Cervical manipulation (especially rotation) â†’ vertebral artery dissection â†’ stroke
- **Incidence:** Very rare (1 in 20,000 to 1 in 250,000 cervical manipulations)
- **Risk factors:** <45 years old, prolonged rotation, pre-existing arterial disease (rare), connective tissue disorders
- **Controversy:** Causation unclear - some patients seek chiropractic for neck pain/headache caused by dissection already in progress
- **Mitigation:** Pre-manipulation screening (dizziness, visual disturbances, difficulty swallowing), avoid forceful rotation, use mobilization instead of HVLA if concerned

**Lumbar Manipulation - Cauda Equina Syndrome:**
- **Extremely rare** (case reports only)
- Disc herniation worsened by manipulation â†’ nerve compression

**Rib Fracture:**
- Rare; more risk in osteoporosis

**Other Rare Complications:**
- Worsened disc herniation, nerve injury, bleeding (on anticoagulants)

### 7.2 Absolute Contraindications

**Do NOT Adjust:**
1. **Fracture** (acute trauma, osteoporotic fracture)
2. **Infection** (osteomyelitis, discitis, spinal TB)
3. **Malignancy** (spinal tumor, metastatic cancer)
4. **Cauda equina syndrome** (medical emergency - immediate referral)
5. **Severe osteoporosis** (fracture risk)
6. **Bleeding disorders / anticoagulation** (on warfarin, heparin - increased bleeding risk)
7. **Vertebrobasilar insufficiency** (symptoms: dizziness, drop attacks, diplopia, dysarthria, dysphagia - "5 Ds")
8. **Acute inflammatory arthritis** (rheumatoid arthritis flare, ankylosing spondylitis acute)
9. **Down syndrome** (atlantoaxial instability risk)

### 7.3 Relative Contraindications (Caution)

1. **Acute disc herniation with severe radiculopathy** (gentle mobilization OK; avoid forceful manipulation)
2. **Spondylolisthesis** (vertebral slippage - high-grade avoid manipulation)
3. **Hypermobility syndromes** (Ehlers-Danlos - joints already too mobile)
4. **Pregnancy** (generally safe with modifications; avoid prone positioning after first trimester)
5. **Severe scoliosis**
6. **Post-surgical spine** (fused segments - adjust adjacent levels carefully)

### 7.4 Pre-Manipulation Screening

**Vertebrobasilar Artery Screen:**
- Ask about: Dizziness, visual disturbances, nausea, difficulty swallowing/speaking, drop attacks
- Test: Sustained cervical rotation/extension (hold 10-30 seconds) - watch for symptoms
- If positive: **Avoid cervical manipulation**, use mobilization, refer for vascular imaging if indicated

**Red Flag Screening:**
- See Assessment section - screen for fracture, cancer, infection, cauda equina

## SECTION 9: CLAUDE'S APPROACH TO CHIROPRACTIC INQUIRIES

**Principles:**

1. **Evidence-Based Focus:** Emphasize conditions with strong evidence (low back pain, neck pain); de-emphasize unproven claims
2. **Safety First:** Screen for contraindications; refer red flags immediately
3. **Realistic Expectations:** Chiropractic helpful for musculoskeletal conditions, not cure-all
4. **Collaborative:** Encourage integration with medical care, not replacement
5. **Patient-Centered:** Acknowledge some people respond well, others don't; trial 4-6 weeks reasonable

**Response Framework:**

When user asks about chiropractic:

1. **Assess condition:**
   - Musculoskeletal (spine, joints) â†’ Chiropractic appropriate
   - Systemic disease, serious pathology â†’ Medical referral

2. **Provide evidence-based information:**
   - What chiropractic can offer
   - Evidence quality for specific condition
   - What to expect (treatment approach, frequency, duration)

3. **Screen for safety:**
   - Red flags?
   - Contraindications?
   - If present, recommend medical evaluation first

4. **Set expectations:**
   - Timeline for results (2-4 weeks trial)
   - Likelihood of benefit based on evidence
   - When to seek additional care

5. **Finding a chiropractor:**
   - Evidence-based, integrative practitioners preferred
   - Avoid: Excessive X-rays, long-term contracts, grandiose claims

**Example Response:**

**User:** "Should I see a chiropractor for my chronic low back pain? I've had it for 6 months."

**Response:**
"Chiropractic care is a reasonable option for chronic low back pain, especially if you haven't tried manual therapy yet. Here's what you should know:

**Evidence:**
- **Moderate evidence** that spinal manipulation provides short-term pain relief and functional improvement for chronic low back pain
- Combination of manipulation + exercise therapy tends to be more effective than either alone

**What to Expect:**
- Spinal adjustments (quick thrusts to restricted vertebrae - you may hear a "crack")
- Soft tissue work (massage-like techniques)
- Exercise prescription (core strengthening, flexibility)
- Typical frequency: 2-3x/week initially, tapering to weekly/monthly
- Trial period: 4-6 weeks to assess response

**Realistic Outcomes:**
- May significantly reduce pain and improve function
- Chronic pain often doesn't fully resolve (goal is management, not cure)
- About 50-60% of chronic low back pain patients report meaningful improvement

**Safety Considerations:**
Before booking, any of these present?
- Recent trauma, severe pain, unexplained weight loss, bowel/bladder issues, progressive leg weakness
- If yes â†’ See MD first for evaluation

**Finding a Chiropractor:**
- Look for evidence-based practitioners who collaborate with other providers
- Avoid chiropractors who: insist on long-term contracts, claim to cure diseases beyond musculoskeletal, use excessive X-rays
- Ask about their approach: Do they combine manipulation with exercise? Do they refer out when appropriate?

**Integration:**
- Chiropractic can work alongside medical care (not a replacement)
- If no improvement after 6 weeks, consider PT referral, pain management, or further medical workup

Would you like guidance on finding a qualified chiropractor or more information on what research shows for your specific type of back pain?"

## CONCLUSION

Chiropractic care offers a valuable, evidence-based approach to musculoskeletal conditions, particularly spinal pain. With strong research support for acute and chronic low back pain and neck pain, spinal manipulation represents a safe, non-pharmaceutical treatment option when appropriately applied.

Modern, evidence-based chiropractors integrate manipulation with rehabilitation, collaborate with other healthcare providers, and recognize the scope and limitations of their practice. While historical vitalistic philosophy (subluxations cause all disease) persists in some circles, the profession increasingly aligns with scientific medicine.

Key principles: screen for red flags, understand contraindications, set realistic expectations based on evidence, use chiropractic as part of multimodal care, and refer appropriately when conditions exceed chiropractic scope.

For users seeking chiropractic guidance, Claude emphasizes evidence-based practice, safety screening, collaborative care, and realistic expectations - empowering informed decisions about this common, generally safe treatment modality.
