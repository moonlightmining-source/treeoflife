# PHYSICAL THERAPY CLINICAL SKILL

## OVERVIEW

Physical therapy (physiotherapy) is a healthcare profession focused on the assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of movement disorders, physical impairments, and functional limitations.

- Prevention is as important as treatment
- Functional outcomes over isolated impairments
- Evidence-based practice integrated with clinical expertise

**Scope of Practice:**
- Musculoskeletal rehabilitation
- Neurological rehabilitation
- Cardiopulmonary rehabilitation
- Pediatric and geriatric physical therapy
- Sports medicine and athletic training
